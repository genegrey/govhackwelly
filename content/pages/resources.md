##The data

Our data wranglers are on the hunt for excellent data sources for you - keep an eye out as we start to list them here.

If you would like a specific dataset (or many), please tell us! We can't promise we can get it for you, but we'll do our best.

##The video

This should be _no_ _longer_ than 3 minutes. 

We'll be posting up lots of useful tips and tricks for how to do this. There's also a video, made by GovHack Australia, with some great tips.
