Summary: Lots of awesome info to help you have the best hackathon ever.

We'll be putting useful videos, links and more here to help you have the best hackathon ever.


##The data

Our data wranglers are on the hunt for excellent data sources for you - keep an eye out as we start to list them here.

If you would like a specific dataset (or many), please tell us! We can't promise we can get it for you, but we'll do our best.

##The video

This should be _no_ _longer_ than 3 minutes. 

It's not nearly as scary as it sounds, and to help you out we've put together some tips. It's an open document, so if you have anything useful to add, go for it :)
