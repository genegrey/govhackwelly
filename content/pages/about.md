GovHack Wellington is all about bringing together coders, artists, storytellers, observers, communicators and more, from the private, public, NGO and academic sectors.

#The cities

GovHack is running in both Australia _and_ New Zealand this year, in:

* Wellington
* Auckland
* Dunedin
* Gisborne
* Whanganui
* Whangarei
* [14 locations in Australia](http://www.govhack.org/locations/).


##The brief

_Use government data in new and interesting ways to tackle existing problems._

The event requires small teams of competitors to produce any kind of “hack” using government data in about 46 hours - from Friday evening to Sunday afternoon. 

The end result of these hacks can be whatever the teams want; the most common are web and mobile apps, and visualisations, but teams can make anything.

##The output

You're going to need to produce a 3 minute video if you want to submit your project to the awards :)

##The awards
While the event is very relaxed, it's also a competition. Your video will be used by judges to decide on the winners of the event, who will get PRIZES.

We're not sure what yet, but they'll be amazing!
