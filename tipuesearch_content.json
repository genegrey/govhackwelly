Without them, we wouldn't have \"tigers\" or be \"slick\", but now, just you wait ... Without companies providing the space (and still paying them) to volunteer for such an event we wouldn't have antyhing, and it's typical of Rabid to step up and support local initiaives. Vend have, since their inception, been long term supporters of local tech events and we're honoured to have the team support us! With free access to the Catalyst Cloud we are grateful for the infrastructure suport provided by Catalyst for the event. From the beginning, the team at OptimalBI have supported GovHackNZ and have removed all hurdles to their staff being involved at all levels.
